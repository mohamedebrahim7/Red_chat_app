# Red chat App


What I did:
I developed a mobile application that facilitates easy and quick communication with friends. The app requires users to sign in using their Gmail accounts for a streamlined authentication process.

How I did it:
The application was built using Firebase Firestore, a NoSQL cloud database, to store and manage user data and chat messages. The authentication system was integrated with Gmail, simplifying the sign-in process for users. Firebase Authentication was employed to handle user authentication securely, ensuring a straightforward experience for users who want to chat with their friends.

The Results I got:
The result is a simple and user-friendly app that allows individuals to sign in effortlessly with their Gmail accounts and start chatting with friends. The integration of Firebase Firestore ensures real-time synchronization of messages, providing a seamless and responsive chat experience for users.
